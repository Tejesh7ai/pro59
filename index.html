        <p> I am Tejesh. I study in 5th grade and my hobbies are skating , BasketBall , Dancing and most importantly Coding <br> <br> Whenever I feel bored and in the mood of creating something I code and also when I complete my homework I code. Coding gives me the freedom to create anything I like to. It also can be done by everyone because once you start coding you will forget everything happening around you and also coding gives you many opportunities to get a good Job when you grow up.</p>
        <p>
            My most favorite hobby Coding is the Universal Language for Computer Science and you can even create 
            Games like "Minecraft" and bulid apps like "Facebook","Twitter","Instagram" etc.
            With Coding you can even bulid Robots that behave like we humans,So hoping that you also will Code and make India to be in the 1st place in Technology.
